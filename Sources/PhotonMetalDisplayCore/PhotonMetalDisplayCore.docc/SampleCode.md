The demo demonstrates how to render a CIImage from a Bundle URL, as well as how to show HDR effect.

![Sample Project Preview](demo-intro)

The demo is compatible with both iOS and macOS. To run it, open the project in Xcode and execute it on your device or simulator.

By default, the demo displays an image from the bundle, such as “Images/test.jpg”. You can modify the code to load your own image.

Furthermore, you can tap the “Show HDR” toggle to switch between standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) rendering.
